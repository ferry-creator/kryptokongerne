We added **node-red UI** and started prototyping the physical setup.

Today we had a blast with getting Jonathan wet. Andreas & Mouna used legos to prototype our mechanism for spraying water (raining) on the user, which was tested propperly and thoroughly.

We also had some trouble with getting our MQTT broker (`MaQiatto`) working, but we will look into that before next time. What we *did* get working in `node-red` today though, was the `node-red-dashboard` UI interface, as well as publishing from MQTT clients (node MCUs).

Here is a cute snapshot of the prototyping area of our table from today:
