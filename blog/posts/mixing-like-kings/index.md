The final prototype for our sourdough hotel has been finished! Watch our video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Lg0A8Coy38).

### Prototype planner
For our prototype planner we decided to make an alpha prototype looking into all the key mechanical elements for the sourdough hotel. This meant looking away from the IOT aspects, and instead try to do as much early stage prototyping of all key elements now. The reasoning being that by adding this onto the mechanical parts later on, would be easy. We feel more prepared stepping into the 3-week period, knowing that these key subcomponents for the prototype was uncovered:
1.  Cooling system
2.  Housing
3.  Rotational element (bottom)
4.  Mixing of the sourdough
5.  Ultrasound sensor
6.  Flour dispenser
7.  Water dispenser/ pump

When we had proved that the elements work fine separately, the next step was to combine them one after one. A small challenge was to place the sourdough glass into the container without breaking the prototype (Again something we wish to look further into) In the prototype development it also became apparent that some elements needed more attention than redeemed firstly. A problem was that the container with sourdough in it was too heavy for the prototype we built (motor not strong enough)Â  Another feature was that the flour dispenser had to be more verticalWe quickly opted for rapid prototyping to get over this hurdle. Ready to move into the 3-week period.
